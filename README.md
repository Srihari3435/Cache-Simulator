# Cache-Simulator
This repository contains a Python implementation of a Direct Mapped Cache simulator. The purpose of this project is to provide an educational tool to understand how direct mapped caching works in a computer system. This simulator takes memory addresses as input and maps them to cache lines based on a direct mapping strategy.

#Introduction
Caching is a crucial concept in computer architecture that improves data retrieval times by storing frequently accessed data in a smaller, faster memory known as cache. A direct mapped cache is a type of cache where each block of main memory maps to exactly one cache line. This project simulates the behavior of a direct mapped cache, helping users visualize and understand cache hits, misses, and the replacement process.

#Features
Memory Address Input: Accepts a list of memory addresses to be accessed.
Cache Hit/Miss Detection: Identifies whether an access results in a cache hit or miss.
Cache Line Replacement: Automatically replaces the old data in the cache line upon a miss.
Visual Representation: Outputs a step-by-step log of the cache's state after each memory access.
